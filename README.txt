*1: 	Problem_00001_hardcoded
*2: 	problem_00002
*3: 	problem_00003_d (after viewing solutions) | VERY FAST
*4: 	problem_00004_b_one_liner (problem_00004 has external is palindrome function; problem_00004_b: inline palindrome function)
*5: 	Problem_00005 => Not submitted yet (code too long)
*6: 	problem_00006_one_liner 
*7: 	problem_00007 => Not submitted (a bit slow, not too much though)
*8: 	problem_00008 (problem_00008_one_liner is not very readabale)
*9: 	problem_00009 => using list comprehensions | SLOW
*10:	problem_00010_c => (had to discard sieve solutions) => CHECK AGAIN (and submit again)!!!| AROUND 7 seconds
