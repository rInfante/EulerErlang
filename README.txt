*8: 	problem_00008 (problem_00008_one_liner is not very readabale)
*9: 	problem_00009 => using list comprehensions | SLOW
*10:	problem_00010_c => (had to discard sieve solutions) => CHECK AGAIN (and submit again)!!!| AROUND 7 seconds
*11: 	TODO
*12:	problem_00012_c => 
			* found solution with: problem_00012_b_3, but have not posted it because slow. It uses memoisation (of triangle numbers), prime number seeding and factorisation 
			* better solution: problem_00012_c, found after viewing problem thread
*13:	problem_00013: not submitted because trivial
*14: 	problem_00014
*15: 	* problem_00015_b: my original approach but it needs a huge amount of memory and stops
		* problem_00015_c: my original solution using pascal triangle
		* math formula (to double check result):
		 (2n n) = (2n)!/(n^2)! = 815915283247897734345611269596115894272000000000 / 2432902008176640000^2
*21:    original solution 21, but slight chnage in 21_ which makes massive perf improvement
*27:
